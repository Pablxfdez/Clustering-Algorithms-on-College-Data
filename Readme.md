### Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a computational geometry project focused on clustering techniques. The primary objective is to group individuals from the Faculty of Mathematics based on their stress levels and affinity for rock music. The project aims to uncover patterns in behavior and characteristics using clustering algorithms.

### Project Description
The project explores the application of clustering techniques to analyze and group data points - in this case, individuals from the Faculty of Mathematics. The data includes variables such as stress levels and affinity for rock music. The key challenges addressed in this project include:

- Determining the optimal number of clusters or Voronoi neighborhoods using the Silhouette coefficient.
- Implementing and comparing the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms, namely KMeans and DBSCAN, with various metrics and distance thresholds.
- Analyzing the data to draw meaningful conclusions about the behavior and characteristics of the individuals in the dataset.

### Code Description
The repository includes several Python scripts that collectively address the project's objectives:

1. **Clustering Algorithms Implementation**: Scripts implementing KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms to perform clustering on the provided dataset. These scripts explore different parameters and metrics to optimize the clustering process.

2. **Silhouette Coefficient Analysis**: A script dedicated to calculating the Silhouette coefficient for different clustering configurations. This analysis helps in determining the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Data Visualization**: Scripts for visualizing the results of the clustering, including the creation of Voronoi diagrams. These visualizations aid in understanding the distribution and grouping of data points.

4. **Predictive Analysis**: A script that uses the clustering results to predict certain attributes or affiliations of individuals based on their coordinates in the dataset.
